# Arduino Keypad Passcode + Melody

## Overview
A small Arduino build, including a keypad to enter in passcodes, lights and buzzers to signify correct or incorrect entries, and a recreation of the Song of Storms from Ocarina of Time, translated from sheet music into timing in milliseconds and notes in frequency.

## Features
- Passcode entry with audio feedback
- Error handling for incorrect inputs
- Music playback functionality

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Keypad module
- Passive buzzer

## Lessons Learned
- Practiced input validation and error handling.
- Translated timing and pitch from sheet music into program logic.

## Future Improvements
- Add an LCD display for passcode entry feedback.
